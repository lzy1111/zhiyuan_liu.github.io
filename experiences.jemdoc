1. Present a novel outer product based deep Factorization Machine(FM) that achieves the highest improvements among all the state-of-art baselines on the Click-through Rate(CTR) prediction task. \n
2. Present a fast approximate nearest neighbor(ANN) search method based on Hierarchical Navigable Small World(HNSW) algorithm with multilayer perceptron(MLP) distance to make the deep learning based FMs\/FFMs applicable to the online serving system. \n
3. Apply some recent deep learning based FMs\/FFMs on the [http://www.newsbreakapp.com/ News Break] App(The No.1 news app on Android and No.2 on iOS in the 2nd quarter of 2019 reported by App Annie with 5M+ daily active users) ForYou datasets(10M instance per day) and evaluate the results which are measured by AUC and test logistic loss.
